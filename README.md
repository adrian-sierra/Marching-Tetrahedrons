# Marching-Tetrahedrons

Marching Tetrahedrons Project

This project was created as part of one of my undergraduate courses, Science Visualization, and uses C++, CMake, and VTK data files in order to run. 

My contribution to the project was to formulate an algorithm that deals with edge cases and execute an a linear equation that will produce the correct results. The algorithm also uses a Class "Tetrahedron" that is created in the "main" function and passed into the algorithm. 

The project works on a large scale data set and produces an image that is made up of the tetrahedrons based on the algorithm. Unfortunately, the data file is too large to store in a single file on GitHub, but if one would like the data set to test or work on this project themselves, they can send me an email at asierra010@gmail.com.
